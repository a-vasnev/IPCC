# IPCC prior project: Magnus and Vasnev (2025)
The IPCC prior project to compute numerical values for 
Magnus and Vasnev (2025) "The role of data and priors in estimating climate sensitivity"
available at 
http://www.janmagnus.nl/papers/prior-ecs.pdf

Table 5 is computed in Matlab; the rest of the calculations are in the Excel file.
At the referee request, we added prior calculations in Matlab as well.

R code is translated from Matlab and gives the same numbers.
